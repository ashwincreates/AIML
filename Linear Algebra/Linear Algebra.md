> [!quote] Linear algebra is the study of vectors and certain rules to manipulate vectors

In general, vectors are special objects that can be added together and
multiplied by scalars to produce another object of the same kind.

We will focus on finite-dimensional vector spaces, in which case there is a 1:1 correspondence between any kind of vector and $R^n$.

##### System of Linear Equation
$$a_{11}x_{11} + \ldots + a_{1n}x_{n} = b_{1}$$
$$\vdots$$
$$a_{11}x_{11} + \ldots + a_{1n}x_{n} = b_{1}$$
This is the general form of a system of linear equations, and
$x_1, . . . , x_n$ are the unknowns of this system. Every n-tuple $(x_1, . . . , x_n) \in R_n$ that satisfies (2.3) is a solution of the linear equation system.

In general, for a real-valued system of linear equations we obtain either
- no
- exactly one
- or infinitely many solutions
